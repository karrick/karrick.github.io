# karrick

I like to program. Mostly in Go and JavaScript. I used to be a Sailor, but spend my professional time now wrangling bits and bytes.
More information may be found on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/karrick) page.

Feel free to browse around [my public repositories](https://github.com/karrick). Some of them are really well developed, while others are still in alpha or beta stage, and yet others are deprecated entirely, but preserved for my own perspective.
